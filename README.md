## Credit and Collaborations
Jordan Yamada helped me understand the code better, as well as understand what is being asked from the Trello Checklist. Tuesday 08/23/2022.
David Suy helped me with the coding, and understanding where things should be placed, along side the "Why?".
After a long long time, with much difficulty, and the help of Jordan Yamada Yamada, Jeffrey Smith, David Suy Ms. Sheyna, and Shane, I finally finished. There was a lot of moving parts, and I can't go into details as to what each one did to help me finish it (cause I forgot), but I would like to give A LOT of credit to them Specially Jordan Yamada, David Suy, and Shane.
